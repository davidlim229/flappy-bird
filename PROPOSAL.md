Guess the Song

	I plan to make a song guessing game in which the player will hear a song playing, 
and then the player can type in the song name. If they're correct, a point is added to their score.
If they're incorrect, they can keep trying to guess the name. If they're stuck, they can choose to pass as well.
There will be a timer running where the player tries to guess as many songs correctly as they can in the allotted time.
At the end, the player's score is announced and a leaderboard will also be available. The songs will be chosen in a random
order. I'm also considering letting the user choose a genre of music that the songs will be picked from. 

	To implement this project, I will need to use the ofSoundPlayer library, which will allow me to access sound files,
letting me load and play songs that the user can guess. Additionally, I will need to use the ofGraphics library to create
the background and make all of the buttons. It will make the user interface look nice basically.

	In terms of how my background will help me in this project, I listen to music a lot, and making a game based ont that
will be more interesting to me than some other projects would be.
