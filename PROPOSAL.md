Flappy Bird Remake

	I plan to remake the game "Flappy Bird". The way it works is that a bird will automatically keep moving right while
there are obstacles (pipes) in the way which can make the bird die and end the game. The user can control the bird only by
making it fly up a fixed height. When the user doesn't make the bird fly up, the bird will automatically descend at a certain rate.
If it hits the ground, the game is over, and if it gets too high, the game is over. The player earns a point for every pipe that is
passed.

	To implement this project, I will need to use the ofSoundPlayer library, which will allow me to access sound files,
letting me load and play sound effects/background music for the game. Additionally, I will need to use the ofGraphics 
library (ofImage) to get the Flappy Bird images and pipe images along with the background. Finally, the ofxGui library will
be used to account for the graphical interface.

	In terms of how my background will help me, I'm familiar with the game Flappy Bird since I used to play it when I was younger.
Also, I somewhat know the ofXGui library and ofGraphics since they were both used in the Snake Linked List Game. This will help me
in knowing how to do certain things with the graphics.
