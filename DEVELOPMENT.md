I tried playing music from a file in this project folder using a tutorial. It took me a bit,
but I realized I needed to move the music file to my data folder inside the bin folder. 

I changed my idea to instead making a flappy bird type game.

Week 1:
Created Bird class and flying/descending mechanic

Week 2:
Added randomized pipes, having struggles with making game smoother/not lag
Making it a vector of pipes made the game lag much more
